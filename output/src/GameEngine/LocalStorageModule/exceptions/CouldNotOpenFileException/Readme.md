# CouldNotOpenFileException - File Opening Exception

## Overview

The `CouldNotOpenFileException` class is a custom exception designed for the R-Type project. It is thrown when there is an issue opening a file within the `LocalStorageModule`. This exception inherits from the standard C++ exception class.

## Structure Explanation

### `CouldNotOpenFileException` Class

```cpp
class CouldNotOpenFileException : public std::exception {
public:
    CouldNotOpenFileException();
    ~CouldNotOpenFileException();
    const char* what() const noexcept override;
};
```

#### Public Methods

- **Constructor and Destructor**:
  - `CouldNotOpenFileException()`: Constructor for initializing the exception.
  - `~CouldNotOpenFileException()`: Destructor for cleanup.

- `const char* what() const noexcept override`: Method providing a description of the exception. It overrides the `what` method of the base `std::exception` class.

## Usage

When using the `LocalStorageModule`, if an attempt to open a file fails, an instance of the `CouldNotOpenFileException` is thrown. To handle this exception, catch it in an appropriate exception handler. The `what` method can be used to retrieve a description of the exception for logging or debugging purposes. This structure allows for a clear and specific exception handling approach when dealing with file opening issues in the `LocalStorageModule`.
