# ClientDisconnectedException - Networking Exception

## Overview

The `ClientDisconnectedException` class is an exception within the R-Type project designed to handle scenarios where a client unexpectedly disconnects during networking operations. This exception is thrown when an unexpected disconnection occurs between a client and the server.

## Structure Explanation

### `ClientDisconnectedException` Class

```cpp
class ClientDisconnectedException : public std::exception {
public:
    // Constructor for initializing the exception.
    ClientDisconnectedException();
    
    // Destructor for cleanup.
    ~ClientDisconnectedException();

    // Method to get a description of the exception.
    const char *what() const noexcept override;
};
```

#### Public Methods

- **Constructor (`ClientDisconnectedException()`) and Destructor (`~ClientDisconnectedException()`)**
  - The constructor initializes the exception when it is thrown, providing a mechanism for handling unexpected client disconnections.
  - The destructor is responsible for any necessary cleanup when the exception is no longer needed.

- **`const char *what() const noexcept override`**
  - This method overrides the `what()` method from the base `std::exception` class. It returns a C-style string providing a description of the exception. Developers can use this information for logging or debugging purposes.

#### Usage Example

```cpp
try {
    // Code that may lead to a client disconnection.
    // ...

    // If a client disconnection is detected, throw the exception.
    throw ClientDisconnectedException();
} catch (const ClientDisconnectedException &e) {
    // Handle the exception, e.g., log the error or take appropriate action.
    std::cerr << "ClientDisconnectedException: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

When a client disconnection is detected in the code, the `ClientDisconnectedException` is thrown. The catch block then handles the exception, providing developers with the ability to log the error or take other appropriate actions.

This exception class is crucial for robust error handling and provides a clear indication when unexpected client disconnections occur during networking operations in the R-Type project.
