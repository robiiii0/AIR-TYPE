# CouldNotBindAddressException - Networking Exception

## Overview

The `CouldNotBindAddressException` class is an exception within the R-Type project designed to handle scenarios where the server encounters difficulties binding a socket to a specific address during networking operations. This exception is thrown when the server cannot successfully bind to the specified address.

## Structure Explanation

### `CouldNotBindAddressException` Class

```cpp
class CouldNotBindAddressException : public std::exception {
public:
    // Constructor for initializing the exception.
    CouldNotBindAddressException();
    
    // Destructor for cleanup.
    ~CouldNotBindAddressException();

    // Method to get a description of the exception.
    const char *what() const throw() override;
};
```

#### Public Methods

- **Constructor (`CouldNotBindAddressException()`) and Destructor (`~CouldNotBindAddressException()`)**
  - The constructor initializes the exception when it is thrown, providing a mechanism for handling cases where the server cannot bind to a specified address.
  - The destructor is responsible for any necessary cleanup when the exception is no longer needed.

- **`const char *what() const throw() override`**
  - This method overrides the `what()` method from the base `std::exception` class. It returns a C-style string providing a description of the exception. Developers can use this information for logging or debugging purposes.

#### Usage Example

```cpp
try {
    // Code that attempts to bind a socket to a specific address.
    // ...

    // If binding to the address fails, throw the exception.
    throw CouldNotBindAddressException();
} catch (const CouldNotBindAddressException &e) {
    // Handle the exception, e.g., log the error or take appropriate action.
    std::cerr << "CouldNotBindAddressException: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

When the server encounters difficulties binding a socket to a specified address in the code, the `CouldNotBindAddressException` is thrown. The catch block then handles the exception, providing developers with the ability to log the error or take other appropriate actions.

This exception class is essential for ensuring proper error handling when the server faces challenges binding to a specific address during networking operations in the R-Type project.
