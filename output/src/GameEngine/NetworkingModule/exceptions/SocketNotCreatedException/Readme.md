# SocketNotCreatedException - Networking Exception

## Overview

The `SocketNotCreatedException` class is an exception within the R-Type project, designed to handle scenarios where the creation of a socket encounters issues. This exception is thrown when the system fails to create a socket, indicating a problem with initializing the networking infrastructure.

## Structure Explanation

### `SocketNotCreatedException` Class

```cpp
class SocketNotCreatedException : public std::exception {
public:
    // Constructor for initializing the exception.
    SocketNotCreatedException();
    
    // Destructor for cleanup.
    ~SocketNotCreatedException();

    // Method to get a description of the exception.
    const char *what() const throw() override;

protected:
private:
};
```

#### Public Methods

- **Constructor (`SocketNotCreatedException()`) and Destructor (`~SocketNotCreatedException()`)**
  - The constructor initializes the exception when it is thrown, indicating that the creation of a socket has failed.
  - The destructor is responsible for any necessary cleanup when the exception is no longer needed.

- **`const char *what() const throw() override`**
  - This method overrides the `what()` method from the base `std::exception` class. It returns a C-style string providing a description of the exception. Developers can use this information for logging or debugging purposes.

#### Usage Example

```cpp
try {
    // Code that attempts to create a socket.
    // ...

    // If creating the socket fails, throw the exception.
    throw SocketNotCreatedException();
} catch (const SocketNotCreatedException &e) {
    // Handle the exception, e.g., log the error or take appropriate action.
    std::cerr << "SocketNotCreatedException: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    // ... Additional handling based on the exception ...
}
```

When the system encounters difficulties during the creation of a socket in the code, the `SocketNotCreatedException` is thrown. The catch block then handles the exception, providing developers with the ability to log the error, take other appropriate actions, and address the issue with socket creation during networking operations in the R-Type project.

This exception class is crucial for ensuring proper error handling and identifying issues related to socket creation in the networking infrastructure of the R-Type project.
