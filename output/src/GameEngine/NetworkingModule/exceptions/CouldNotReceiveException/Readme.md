# CouldNotReceiveException - Networking Exception

## Overview

The `CouldNotReceiveException` class is an exception within the R-Type project designed to handle scenarios where the server encounters difficulties while attempting to receive data over the network. This exception is thrown when the server cannot successfully receive data.

## Structure Explanation

### `CouldNotReceiveException` Class

```cpp
class CouldNotReceiveException : public std::exception {
public:
    // Constructor for initializing the exception.
    CouldNotReceiveException();
    
    // Destructor for cleanup.
    ~CouldNotReceiveException();

    // Method to get a description of the exception.
    const char *what() const noexcept override;
};
```

#### Public Methods

- **Constructor (`CouldNotReceiveException()`) and Destructor (`~CouldNotReceiveException()`)**
  - The constructor initializes the exception when it is thrown, providing a mechanism for handling cases where the server cannot receive data.
  - The destructor is responsible for any necessary cleanup when the exception is no longer needed.

- **`const char *what() const noexcept override`**
  - This method overrides the `what()` method from the base `std::exception` class. It returns a C-style string providing a description of the exception. Developers can use this information for logging or debugging purposes.

#### Usage Example

```cpp
try {
    // Code that attempts to receive data over the network.
    // ...

    // If receiving data fails, throw the exception.
    throw CouldNotReceiveException();
} catch (const CouldNotReceiveException &e) {
    // Handle the exception, e.g., log the error or take appropriate action.
    std::cerr << "CouldNotReceiveException: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

When the server encounters difficulties while attempting to receive data over the network in the code, the `CouldNotReceiveException` is thrown. The catch block then handles the exception, providing developers with the ability to log the error or take other appropriate actions.

This exception class is crucial for ensuring proper error handling when the server faces challenges while receiving data over the network during networking operations in the R-Type project.
