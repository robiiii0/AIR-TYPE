# CouldNotSendException - Networking Exception

## Overview

The `CouldNotSendException` class is an exception within the R-Type project, specifically designed to handle scenarios where the server encounters difficulties while attempting to send data over the network to a client. This exception is thrown when the server cannot successfully send data to a client.

## Structure Explanation

### `CouldNotSendException` Class

```cpp
class CouldNotSendException : public std::exception {
public:
    // Constructor for initializing the exception with information about the client.
    CouldNotSendException(Engine::Network::Client client);
    
    // Destructor for cleanup.
    ~CouldNotSendException();

    // Method to get a description of the exception.
    const char *what() const throw() override;

protected:
private:
    // Member variable to store information about the client associated with the exception.
    Client _client;
};
```

#### Public Methods

- **Constructor (`CouldNotSendException(Engine::Network::Client client)`) and Destructor (`~CouldNotSendException()`)**
  - The constructor initializes the exception when it is thrown, providing information about the client associated with the send operation that encountered an issue.
  - The destructor is responsible for any necessary cleanup when the exception is no longer needed.

- **`const char *what() const throw() override`**
  - This method overrides the `what()` method from the base `std::exception` class. It returns a C-style string providing a description of the exception. Developers can use this information for logging or debugging purposes.

#### Member Variable

- **`Client _client`**
  - A member variable that stores information about the client associated with the exception. This information helps developers identify the specific client for which the send operation failed.

#### Usage Example

```cpp
try {
    // Code that attempts to send data over the network to a client.
    // ...

    // If sending data fails, throw the exception with information about the client.
    throw CouldNotSendException(client);
} catch (const CouldNotSendException &e) {
    // Handle the exception, e.g., log the error or take appropriate action.
    std::cerr << "CouldNotSendException: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    // Access information about the client associated with the exception.
    Client failedClient = e.getClient();
    // ... Additional handling based on client information ...
}
```

When the server encounters difficulties while attempting to send data over the network to a client in the code, the `CouldNotSendException` is thrown. The catch block then handles the exception, providing developers with the ability to log the error, take other appropriate actions, and access information about the specific client associated with the failed send operation.

This exception class is essential for ensuring proper error handling when the server faces challenges while sending data over the network to clients during networking operations in the R-Type project.
