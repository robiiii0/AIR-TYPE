# ClientIdOutOfRangeException - Networking Exception

## Overview

The `ClientIdOutOfRangeException` class is an exception within the R-Type project designed to handle scenarios where a client's unique identifier falls outside the expected range during networking operations. This exception is thrown when an invalid or out-of-range client ID is detected.

## Structure Explanation

### `ClientIdOutOfRangeException` Class

```cpp
class ClientIdOutOfRangeException : public std::exception {
public:
    // Constructor for initializing the exception.
    ClientIdOutOfRangeException();
    
    // Destructor for cleanup.
    ~ClientIdOutOfRangeException();

    // Method to get a description of the exception.
    const char *what() const throw() override;
};
```

#### Public Methods

- **Constructor (`ClientIdOutOfRangeException()`) and Destructor (`~ClientIdOutOfRangeException()`)**
  - The constructor initializes the exception when it is thrown, providing a mechanism for handling cases where a client's unique identifier is out of range.
  - The destructor is responsible for any necessary cleanup when the exception is no longer needed.

- **`const char *what() const throw() override`**
  - This method overrides the `what()` method from the base `std::exception` class. It returns a C-style string providing a description of the exception. Developers can use this information for logging or debugging purposes.

#### Usage Example

```cpp
try {
    // Code that may lead to a client ID being out of range.
    // ...

    // If an out-of-range client ID is detected, throw the exception.
    throw ClientIdOutOfRangeException();
} catch (const ClientIdOutOfRangeException &e) {
    // Handle the exception, e.g., log the error or take appropriate action.
    std::cerr << "ClientIdOutOfRangeException: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

When an out-of-range client ID is detected in the code, the `ClientIdOutOfRangeException` is thrown. The catch block then handles the exception, providing developers with the ability to log the error or take other appropriate actions.

This exception class is essential for ensuring that client identifiers remain within the expected range during networking operations in the R-Type project.
