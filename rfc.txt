                                R-TYPE Protocol

Abstract:
    This document describes the protocol used by the r-type_server to communicate
    with a r-type_client.

Introduction:
    The goal of this project is to create a server and a client,
    they communicate through our own UDP socket. The server hosts a game
    that has to be playable by an human and displayable by a GUI. The server and
    the AI exchange informations, so can the GUI and the server, though the
    GUI and the AI cannot communicate with each other. The server can both send
    informations without any prior interactions, and answer requests.

Command and return:
    When sending or receiving a command to or from the server, the message
    should contain a code, a blank space, parameters if needed, separated by
    spaces, and be terminated by a \n.
    [Code] [Space] [Parameters]

Connection:
    When connecting to the server, a client will be set in a transitory state
    before he confirms his identity by sending either GRAPHICAL for a GUI, or
    the team_name for an AI. Only after that, if there is no other GUI, or if
    the team isn't full, you will be connected and ready to interact with the
    game.
